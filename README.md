## Comment:
Uhm.. It works pretty well but there are easy ways to cheat since stuff is clear text from api calls. There are many ways to solve it, but maybe just adding a page after putting in answers that it takes you to that then handles the right answers and saves the score to DB. That also adds some more excitement to the consept itself while also solving some issues.

## TODO

* [X] CV Paste stuff from old project
